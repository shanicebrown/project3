<h2>I have went back and forth about it and my 1st, 2nd and 3rd reaction is pure
disgust. </h2>

 <h3>I DO NOT LIKE the "This is America" VIDEO by Childish Gambino... </h3>

<p>No, I do not see the "art" in the trauma, death and execution of Black bodies.
Personally I am so tired of being triggered by the careless and utter disregard
for Black life. I, me, Gail, do not need to see Black death expressed in an
artsy and intentional way. There is a word for this, Contrived. Dig deeper
Donald... </p>

<p>For those that say that is the point, I say, let me chose to consume violence at
my own whim. I have blocked, muted, unfriended and unfollowed any and all
threats to my psyche. Did I cry when Mufasa died at the hands of his own
brother? Hell Yes! I also cried when Richard "Cochise" Morris was beat to death
in Cooley High and when Ricky was shot in Boyz in the Hood.</p>

<p>I could go on, But The Point Is, I cannot watch those movies with the same
ignorance now from when I was an adolescent. We are not 4 nappy headed lil boys
looking to see a dead body.</p>

<p>If you shared the video of that girl getting raped and I was forced to see it,
you got reported and blocked.</p>

<p>I chose not to view the lifeless body of Kenneka Jenkins in the freezer:
reported and blocked. </p>

<p>I do not want to view the dead and/or mutilated bodies of adults or children in
Syria, Kenya, Nigeria, Florida, Kansas City, Asgard, Krypton, the Moon or
anywhere else. </p>

<p>This is not something I want in my spirit or to see when I close my eyes; and I
still see the lifeless mutilated body of Kendrick Johnson, Trayvon Martin and
Mike Brown. I still see Walter Scott getting shot in the back when he turned to
run for his life, I still see11 year old's Tamir Rice's last moments on Earth
from a surveillance camera... I can recall seeing the deceased and bloted bodies
of our New Orleans Sister and Brothers that 'Our America' news media so
carelessly showed on the daily news coverage of Katrina in 2005. The
carelessness, blatant disregard and hurt.</p>

<p>My prayer is that Time and The Creator remove those visuals from my memory...
Taking the images but never the feelings they invoke or the rage and love that
motivates.</p>

<p>At the very least, a trigger warning would have been nice. But if "giving it to
em' raw and uncut" is the point, how far has that gotten us from seeing our
predecessors sprayed with water hoses, beaten with batons and our flesh torn by
German shepherds, but more desensitized to the "art of Death and Black bodies"?</p>

<p>We are not new to this, we are true to this. It's pathological. Yes, yes you are
a genius Gambino, and you can do better than this.</p>
